# Number Guessing Game – C Project

# Project Description
This project is a simple Number Guessing Game developed in the C programming language.  
In this game, the computer stores a secret number, and the user has limited attempts to guess it correctly. After each guess, the program provides hints such as "Too high" or "Too low" to help the user.

The project demonstrates the use of loops, conditional statements, user input handling, and basic game logic in C.

# Aim of the Project
The aim of this project is to develop an interactive game that:
- allows the user to guess a secret number
- provides hints after every guess
- limits the number of attempts
- displays win/lose message at the end

# Future Scope

This project can be improved in the future by:

- generating **random secret numbers**
- adding **difficulty levels** (Easy/Medium/Hard)
- recording **scores**
- adding **graphical interface**
- letting player choose **number range**
- providing **replay option**
- using **file handling** to store best scores

## How the Game Works (Working Principle)

1. Program stores a secret number  
2. User is asked to guess the number  
3. After each guess:
   - If guess is high → shows **"Try smaller number"**
   - If guess is low → shows **"Try larger number"**
4. Attempts are counted  
5. If the user guesses correctly → **WIN message**  
6. If attempts finish → **LOSE message**
